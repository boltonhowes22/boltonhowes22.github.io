Between 2012 and 2016 I intermittently worked at the [Peary-MacMillan Arctic Museum](https://www.bowdoin.edu/arctic-museum/) on the campus of Bowdoin College, first as a student tour guide (2012-2014) and later as the Curatorial Intern (2015-2016).
During my time at PMAM, I collaborated with faculty to bring students into the museum for object-based learning experiences, prepared and ran pop-up museum events, and improved the student tour guide training program.

In this space, I first became captivated with the Arctic and polar studies. This fascination with the high-latitudes and frigid climates has played no small role in shaping my research interests.
My time at PMAM crystallized my ongoing dedication to museum-based outreach.
