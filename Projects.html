          <p style="margin-top: 0;">Ooids are one of the most common constituents of the carbonate rock record and there is a long history of trying to develop methods for using ooid size, shape, abundance, and mineralogy to reconstruct the conditions of the ancient ocean. These attempts have been hindered by the inability to make accurate measurements of ooid size and shape.</p>
  
          <p>Through a series of numerical experiments, I realized that measurement errors associated with measuring a three-dimensional grain in two dimensions (e.g., thin sections and polished slabs) was introducing errors that overwhelmed the environmental signals encoded in the morphology of ooids. I then developed a method using <a href="https://giri.princeton.edu/">GIRI</a> to measure ooids and ooid growth bands in three dimensions. Manuscript available here: <a href="https://doi.org/10.1029/2020JF005601">[journal]</a></p>
          
          <p>In a follow up project, I measured the growth histories of ooids by tracing their laminations. I found that many of the popular models of ooid growth have been overestimating the role of abrasion in the formation of ooids. With these new insights into ooid formation, it became possible to better explain the distribution of ooids geographically and the abundance of ooids through the Phanerozoic. This manuscript is currently in review, but will hopefully be available soon!</p>
