The students learned to combine quantitative observations derived from remote sensing and field measurements to study how the landscape has responded to climate change. Each student chose a research location in Utah, and study using historical satellite data and develop a field plan to ground truth, and supplement the remote sensing data during a fall break trip. To analyze the data, students learned important statistical techniques like principal components analysis and multiple linear regression. The students also learn how to effectively communicate their findings through multiple drafts and revisions of their research papers. <br><b>Instructors:</b> Profs. Adam Maloof and Amanda Wilkins

### Responsibilities
Assist students with problem sets, fieldwork, and data analysis. Students used tools such as Matlab, QGIS, and LateX for the course, so I helped students learn to use and implement these tools. I also prepared all of the field equipment, flew a drone while on the field trip, and processed all the drone data. 

### Topics Covered
Remote sensing, climate systems, image processing (normalization, segmentation, band ratios), linear regression, k-means clustering, principal components analysis. Effective science writing techniques such as structuring a scientific paper, developing motive, summarizing previous research, and making figures that efficiently communicate their findings.
