The course focuses on the relationship between climate and weather events. Each weather event is unique and not predictable more than a few days in advance, but large-scale climate constrain the probability of weather events.<br><b>Instructors:</b> Prof. Gabe Vecchi

### Responsibilities
I assisted  students in the completion of problem sets and in-class activities. Problem sets focused on understanding weather and climate data using simple statistics and data interpretation. In-class activities centered around discussing seminal papers in climate science, often weighing the merits of papers that contradicted each other. I also graded and developed answer keys for the problem sets and exams.

### Topics Covered
The course begins by covering features of climate such as energy and water cycling, the El Ni√±o phenomenon, ice ages, and greenhouse gases. Then uses these climate features to understand weather events including heat waves, tropical cyclones, and floods. My favorite topic in the course was studying the record of hurricanes in the Atlantic Ocean to determine if the frequency and intensity of hurricanes has changed over the last 200 years. Fivethirtyeight has since written an article based on the research covered in this section of the course, which can be found [here](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-past-hurricane-seasons-dont-tell-us-much-about-the-future/).
