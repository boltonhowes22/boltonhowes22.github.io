Radiogenic and stable isotope geochemistry: isotopic systems and their applications in the Earth sciences. <br><b>Instructors:</b> Profs. Terrence Blackburn and Jim Zachos.

### Responsibilities
Script, record, and produce five 10-20 minute videos demonstrating isotope geochemistry laboratory methods and narrating the progression of a geochemical study.
Collected isotopic data for students to interpret in final project. (Remote Instruction)

### Topics Covered
Rock sample preparation, including wet chemistry methods (sample digestion and ion-exchange column chemistry), fundamentals of mass spectrometry, and various isotopic analysis methods:
  carbonate δ<sup>13</sup>C and δ<sup>18</sup>O by iRMS;
  carbonate <sup>87</sup>Sr/<sup>86</sup>Sr by TIMS;
  carbonate <sup>230</sup>Th-<sup>232</sup>Th-<sup>234</sup>U-<sup>238</sup>U by ID-TIMS;
  water δD, δ<sup>17</sup>O, and δ<sup>18</sup>O by laser analyzer;
  and organic C and N abundance, δ<sup>13</sup>C, and δ<sup>15</sup>N by CN-EA-iRMS.
