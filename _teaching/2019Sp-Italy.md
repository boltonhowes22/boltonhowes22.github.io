The students used remote sensing, historical climate data, and field measurements to study how the olive orchards in Calabria, Italy responded to climate change. To analyze the data, students learned techniques including multiple linear regression, fourier transforms, and various clustering algorithms. During Fall Break, the class traveled to southern Italy and studied three olive orchards measuring tree height and width, soil pH, and collecting drone imagery. Upon returning, students combined the historical and remote sensing data with field measurements for a final paper and presentation. <br><b>Instructors:</b> Profs. Adam Maloof and Frederik Simons

### Responsibilities
Assist students with problem sets, fieldwork, and data analysis. The course was a freshman seminar, so it was the students' first time using tools like Matlab and LaTeX, so I helped students learn to use and implement these tools. I also prepared all of the field equipment, flew a drone while on the field trip, and processed all the drone data.

### Topics Covered
Remote sensing, image processing (normalization, segmentation, band ratios), linear regression, time series analysis, and principal components analysis.
