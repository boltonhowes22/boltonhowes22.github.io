Earth's climate is intertwined with the carbonate chemistry of the ocean, which makes carbonate rock an excellent archive of our planet's climate history. My current work on carbonates is focused on understanding how ooids (sand-sized carbonate grains) form and what ooid morphology can tell us about ancient environments.

The first part of this project focused on developing methods for reconstructing ooid morphology in 3D using Princeton's [Grinding, Imaging, and Reconstructing Instrument](https://giri.princeton.edu/). We trained a simple convolutional neural network to segment the 3D image stack and conducted several experiments using the morphology of the reconstructed ooids to demonstrate how 3D measurments improve environmental reconstructions.

<!As a National Science Foundation Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics Postdoctoral Fellow, I am using statistical and computational methods to interrogate extant meteorite chemical data, working under the mentorship of [Prof. C. Brenhin Keller](https://brenhinkeller.github.io/) and [Prof. Elisabeth Newton](https://newton.host.dartmouth.edu/).>

Project goals include:
1. Build improved chemical models of planetesimals from the inner and outer regions of the solar system to evaluate the observed compositional differences between the Sun and very similar "solar twins" (e.g. [Mel√©ndez+, 2009](https://arxiv.org/abs/0909.2299)).
2. Examine the thermochronologic histories of chondrites with Bayesian statistical models to evaluate the timescales of giant planet migration in the young solar system. Check out our [MetSoc poster](../files/Edwards_metsoc22.pdf) on preliminary findings!
