I use a variety of geochemical tools, including U-series isotopes, to reconstruct time and process in subglacial systems.

### Subglacial Waters

While we often think of glaciers and ice sheets in terms of their frozen water (ice), expansive and dynamic reservoirs of liquid water can exist beneath the ice. I am curious about how subglacial waters evolve and interact with the overlying ice. To reconstruct the characteristics and timescales of these subglacial waters, I study mineral precipitate rocks that formed out of these subglacial waters.

The Laurentide Ice Sheet used to cover much of North America, reaching its greatest size and extent during the last glacial maximum about 20,000 years ago. Today, all that remains of the ice sheet is the Barnes Ice Cap of Baffin Island. Carbonate rocks preserved at the edge of the ice cap formed out of waters that flowed there beneath &gt;1000 meters of ice during the last glacial maximum.

Using U-Th geochronology, we found that these rocks all formed during episodes of rapid iceberg discharge, called Heinrich events. Our results help constrain the long-debated stimulus of these Heinrich Events. By measuring several different isotopic systems, we reconstructed the origins of the parent waters of these rocks, showing that they formed from distantly sourced waters that traveled through a long, interconnected network of water beneath the ice sheet.

### Subglacial Rocks
Glaciers wear away at the very land they sit on as the ice flows and slides over it. At the base of glaciers, pieces of rock are entrained in the ice and dragged along the ground, or “bed,” gouging and chipping the bedrock as the ice moves. Processes like this grind, wear, and otherwise break down, or __*comminute*__, the bedrock and subglacial sediment. In these fine particles, the recoil experienced by U-series nuclides during radioactive decay can result in ejection of daughter nuclides from particles. For an overview of U-series geochemistry and a summary of comminution dating,  [read this](https://grahamedwards.github.io/research/u-comm).

U-series comminution dating, while a challenging technique fraught with complications, offers a unique chronometric tool for understanding the timescales of erosive processes. I have been using U-series comminution techniques to constrain the timing of sediment comminution in Taylor Valley, Antarctica (image). Taylor Valley silts exhibit complex U-series systematics reflecting a variety of weathering histories, and more dynamic glacial erosion by Taylor Glacier than previously thought! I am currently preparing a manuscript on the results of this study. I kept a blog of our 2017 fieldwork that you can read [on my old website](https://edwardsgh.wordpress.com/blogs/taylor-valley-antarctica-2017/).

excerpt: I use U-series isotopes to study the subglacial systems of ice sheets. <br/>
~~Text Scrapyard~~
Throughout the Pleistocene and Holocene, glaciers and ice sheets have served as major water reservoirs. Ice sheets have sequestered and released meters to many tens of meters of sea level on 100-thousand to million year timescales. While the behavior of glaciers reciprocally controls and is controlled by the climate system, the responses of ice masses to these climate forcings are strongly modulated by processes at the glacier bases. In these basal and subglacial regions, the ice mass interacts with sediments and waters that affect the dynamics of the overlying ice sheet.

U-series radionuclides record aqueous and sedimentary processes on Pleistocene timescales.

My interests in subglacial systems extend beyond the sediments and into the porewaters and basal ice. As U-series daughter nuclides are ejected from sediments, they accumulate in porewaters and ice. As a result of this process, hypersaline brines erupted from the snout of Taylor Glacier (below), an outlet of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet, reflect <sup>234</sup>U/<sup>238</sup>U compositions a factor of 5 greater than bedrock values.
 
The U-series compositions of glacial meltwaters and products of these meltwaters can thus serve as critical measures of subglacial conditions and processes. Current work on this subject includes both isotopic measurements of subglacially formed waterlain precipitates as well as isotopic chemical models of subglacial and periglacial systems.


On the other side of the world, hypersaline brines sourced from the East Antarctic Ice Sheet interior erupt from the snout of Taylor Glacier. As the dissolved iron in the brine oxidizes, it turns bright red, giving the feature its name: _Blood Falls_.
