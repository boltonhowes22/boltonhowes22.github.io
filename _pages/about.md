My research focuses on developing and implementing quantitative techniques for studying the sedimentary record and Earth history.

I am a Ph.D. Candidate in the Department of Geosciences at Princeton University.

Prior to my Ph.D., I:
 - received my masters in 2017 from the University of Georgia, where I worked in the [Holland Lab](http://strata.uga.edu/).  
 -  did my undergraduate studies at Macalester College studying geology and classics. I primarily worked with [Prof. Ray Rogers](https://rogerslab.weebly.com/).
