I am an NSF Astronomy & Astrophysics Postdoctoral Fellow at Dartmouth College.

My research spans the fields of cosmochemistry, isotope geochemistry, and geochronology. 

**Metorites** are relics from the dawn of our solar system and offer a glimpse into the primordial processes that formed the planets and Sun. I use computational, chemical, and geochronologic methods to reconstruct solar system history at a high-resolution from the meteorite record. I am particularly interested in contextualizing our solar system among other stellar and planetary systems.

**Ice Sheets** have intermittently covered the landmasses of the northern hemisphere over the last several million years. I study subglacial systems with isotope geochemistry and U-series geochronology to better understand the behavior and life cycles of glaciers and ice sheets.

I received my PhD in 2021 from the University of California Santa Cruz, where I worked in the [Blackburn Lab](https://ucscgeochronology.sites.ucsc.edu/). In my [dissertation](https://escholarship.org/uc/item/0vp7r59z), I used isotope geochemistry and geochronology to explore:
1. [the interplay between glaciers and their environments](../_research/res-2-subglacial.md)  
2. [the timescales and processes of planetary assembly in the early solar system](../_research/res-3-chondrite.md)
3. [billion-year timescales of middle crustal cooling and reheating](../_research/res-4-thermochron.md)

I am committed to accessible and engaging education, within and beyond classrooms. Museums provide unique opportunities for poignant, immersive, and dynamic educational experiences. To learn more aobut my work with museums, check out my [Outreach](outreach.md) page.
